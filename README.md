# Week 18 Challenge - Social Network API

## Description

This project is a social media application where users can create thoughts and share reactions to other user's thoughts. The API for the social network leverages a NoSQL database to handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## User Story

As a social media startup, I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a social network API:

- **Server Startup:** When I enter the command to invoke the application, my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.
- **API GET routes:** When I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
- **API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes:** When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.
- **API POST and DELETE routes for Reactions and Friends:** When I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia, I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list.
